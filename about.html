    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="formatted-paragraph">
    <p>This week's assignment deals with creating and manipulating the HTML5 Canvas element. I had absolutely no experience with this
         and was excited to give it a try. I like systems like Canvas that allow most of the code and work to be done in a separate
          file. I am all for minimalistic HTML. On top of that, Canvas is incredibly capable. When I initially started working with it
           I thought it was overly complicated, but after further use and study, I began to appreciate the versatility of the element.
            I even messed around with creating a spreadsheet with it. The most difficult thing about my experience with Cavas was 
            figuring out how to add padding between graph elements as I just found it complicated to understand how each input pushes 
            the other elements around. However, I was able to make enough sense of it to complete my graph and get it to an easily 
            readable state. Overall I greatly enjoyed this intro to Canvas and am looking forward to using it in the final project! </p>
