        <p>Hello there!
            My name is Jonathan Cifonie and I am in the Senior year of my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology: Web Development and Mobile Programming. <br>
           I currently live in Freeport, Illinois with my parents and 4 of my 6 siblings but hope to relocate to Fort Worth, Texas within the next year. <br> 
            My hobbies include lifting, reading, and messing around with investments. However, the majority of my time is spent doing school and working as a landscaper. <br>
            I am finishing up my degree this semester with two summer classes and upon completion I am looking forward to getting a job with real-world experience! <br>
            One of my favorite quotes is from Socrates, and it goes as follows:<br><br>
           <em>"Let him who would move the world first move himself"<br></em>
           <strong>-Socrates</strong><br><br>
           I think these are strong words to live by as they outline the principles found in Scripture, especially throughout Proverbs that display the importance of rooting yourself <br>
           in a firm foundation based on God's truth and integrity. I believe we must fulfill such principles and do our part to not only bring about eternal change in this life, <br>
           but temporary change that will lead to a more abundant life, filled with God's blessings.<br>
           Thanks for taking the time to visit my website!
        </p>
